### Intermideate JavaScript Interview Questions - Answers

1.  **What is JavaScript?**

    JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed, and object-oriented programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web content on the client-side (in web browsers). It makes web pages more engaging by enabling features like animations, form validations, interactive maps, and much more. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, enabling full-stack development with a single language.

2.  **What are the different data types in JavaScript?**

    JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

      * **Primitive Data Types:** These represent single, simple values and are immutable (cannot be changed once created).

          * `string`: Represents sequences of characters (e.g., `"hello"`, `'world'`).
          * `number`: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers (e.g., `10`, `3.14`).
          * `boolean`: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`.
          * `null`: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's a primitive value.
          * `undefined`: Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
          * `symbol` (ES6): Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.
          * `bigint` (ES11): Represents whole numbers larger than `2^53 - 1`, useful for handling very large integers.

      * **Non-Primitive Data Type (Object):** These represent more complex values and are mutable. They are collections of properties.

          * `object`: The base type for all complex data structures. This includes:
              * **Objects:** Key-value pairs (e.g., `{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }`).
              * **Arrays:** Ordered collections of values (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
              * **Functions:** Special type of object that can be called (e.g., `function() {}`).

3.  **Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.**

    These keywords are used to declare variables in JavaScript, and they differ primarily in their scope and mutability:

      * **`var`**:

          * **Scope:** Function-scoped. Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, regardless of block boundaries (like `if` statements or `for` loops).
          * **Hoisting:** `var` declarations are "hoisted" to the top of their function scope. This means you can use a `var` variable before it's declared in the code, though its value will be `undefined` until the actual declaration line is reached.
          * **Re-declaration/Re-assignment:** Can be re-declared and re-assigned within the same scope without error. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function exampleVar() {
          console.log(myVar); // undefined (due to hoisting)
          var myVar = 10;
          console.log(myVar); // 10

          var myVar = 20; // Re-declaration is allowed
          console.log(myVar); // 20
        }
        exampleVar();
        // console.log(myVar); // Error: myVar is not defined (function-scoped)
        ```

      * **`let`**:

          * **Scope:** Block-scoped. Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block (curly braces `{}`) where they are defined.
          * **Hoisting:** `let` declarations are also hoisted, but they are in a "temporal dead zone" until their declaration line is executed. Attempting to access them before declaration will result in a `ReferenceError`.
          * **Re-declaration/Re-assignment:** Can be re-assigned, but **cannot** be re-declared within the same block scope.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function exampleLet() {
          // console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization (temporal dead zone)
          let myLet = 10;
          console.log(myLet); // 10

          myLet = 20; // Re-assignment is allowed
          console.log(myLet); // 20

          // let myLet = 30; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'myLet' has already been declared
        }
        exampleLet();
        ```

      * **`const`**:

          * **Scope:** Block-scoped, just like `let`.
          * **Hoisting:** Similar to `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted into a temporal dead zone.
          * **Re-declaration/Re-assignment:** **Cannot** be re-assigned or re-declared after initialization. It must be initialized at the time of declaration.
          * **Important Note:** For objects and arrays declared with `const`, the *reference* to the object/array cannot be changed, but the *contents* of the object/array *can* be modified.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function exampleConst() {
          // const myConst; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
          const myConst = 10;
          console.log(myConst); // 10

          // myConst = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
          // const myConst = 30; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'myConst' has already been declared

          const myArray = [1, 2];
          myArray.push(3); // Allowed: modifying the content of the array
          console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 3]

          // myArray = [4, 5]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. (changing the reference is not allowed)
        }
        exampleConst();
        ```

    **Best Practice:** Prefer `const` by default. If a variable needs to be re-assigned, use `let`. Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript due to its confusing hoisting and scoping behavior.

4.  **What is Hoisting in JavaScript?**

    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope (global or function scope) during the **compilation phase** before the code actually executes.

      * **`var` and Function Declarations:** Both `var` declarations and function declarations are fully hoisted. This means you can use a `var` variable or call a function *before* its actual declaration in the code. However, for `var` variables, only the *declaration* is hoisted, not the *initialization*. So, accessing a `var` variable before its assignment will result in `undefined`.

        ```javascript
        console.log(a);     // undefined (declaration is hoisted, assignment is not)
        var a = 5;
        console.log(a);     // 5

        myFunction();       // "Hello from hoisted function!"
        function myFunction() {
          console.log("Hello from hoisted function!");
        }
        ```

      * **`let` and `const` Declarations:** While `let` and `const` declarations are *also* hoisted to the top of their block scope, they are placed in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) until the line where they are declared is executed. Attempting to access them before this point will result in a `ReferenceError`. This makes `let` and `const` safer and more predictable than `var`.

        ```javascript
        // console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
        let b = 10;
        console.log(b); // 10
        ```

    In essence, hoisting allows you to logically structure your code by placing declarations later, knowing that the JavaScript engine has already processed them. However, understanding its nuances, especially with `var`, is crucial to avoid bugs.

5.  **What is the difference between `==` and `===` operators?**

    These operators are used for comparison in JavaScript, but they handle type conversion differently:

      * **`==` (Loose Equality / Abstract Equality Comparison):**

          * Performs **type coercion** before comparing the values. This means if the operands are of different types, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both operands to a common type before making the comparison.
          * This can lead to unexpected or counter-intuitive results.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        console.log(10 == "10");     // true (string "10" is coerced to number 10)
        console.log(0 == false);     // true (false is coerced to 0)
        console.log(null == undefined); // true
        console.log("" == 0);        // true
        console.log([] == 0);        // true (empty array coerced to "")
        console.log([1] == "1");     // true
        ```

      * **`===` (Strict Equality / Strict Equality Comparison):**

          * Compares both the **value** and the **data type** without any type coercion.
          * If the operands are of different types, it immediately returns `false`. This provides more predictable and reliable comparisons.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        console.log(10 === "10");    // false (number vs string)
        console.log(0 === false);    // false (number vs boolean)
        console.log(null === undefined); // false
        console.log("" === 0);       // false
        console.log([] === 0);       // false
        console.log([1] === "1");    // false
        ```

    **Recommendation:** Always prefer using the strict equality operator (`===`) unless you have a very specific reason to use loose equality and fully understand its coercion rules. It helps prevent unexpected behavior and makes your code more robust.

6.  **What is the "this" keyword in JavaScript? How does its value change?**

    The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a special identifier that refers to the **context in which the current code is being executed**. Its value is not static; it changes depending on *how* a function is called (its invocation context). Understanding `this` is crucial because it often dictates which object a function operates on.

    Here's how `this` typically behaves:

      * **Global Context:**

          * In the global scope (outside any function), `this` refers to the **global object**.
          * In browsers, the global object is `window`.
          * In Node.js, the global object is `global`.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        console.log(this === window); // true (in a browser)
        ```

      * **Method Invocation (Object Method):**

          * When a function is called as a method of an object (using dot notation), `this` refers to the **object that owns the method**.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        const person = {
          name: "Alice",
          greet: function() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
          }
        };
        person.greet(); // 'this' refers to 'person' object. Output: "Hello, my name is Alice"
        ```

      * **Simple Function Invocation (Standalone Function - Non-Strict Mode):**

          * When a function is called without being a method of an object (a "naked" function call), in **non-strict mode**, `this` defaults to the **global object** (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js). This is a common source of confusion and bugs.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function sayHello() {
          console.log(`Hello from ${this.name || 'global object'}`);
        }
        // In browser:
        // window.name = "Global Scope";
        sayHello(); // 'this' refers to 'window'. Output: "Hello from Global Scope" (if window.name is set)

        const anotherPerson = { name: "Bob", say: sayHello };
        anotherPerson.say(); // 'this' refers to 'anotherPerson'. Output: "Hello from Bob"
        ```

      * **Simple Function Invocation (Standalone Function - Strict Mode):**

          * In **strict mode** (`'use strict';`), `this` in a standalone function call is `undefined`. This helps prevent accidental global variable creation and makes `this` behavior more predictable.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        'use strict';
        function sayStrictHello() {
          console.log(this); // undefined
        }
        sayStrictHello();
        ```

      * **Constructor Invocation (`new` keyword):**

          * When a function is called with the `new` keyword (acting as a constructor), `this` refers to the **newly created instance of the object**.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function Dog(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
        const myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
        console.log(myDog.name); // "Buddy" ('this' inside Dog refers to myDog)
        ```

      * **Explicit Binding (`call`, `apply`, `bind`):**

          * These methods allow you to explicitly set the value of `this` for a function.
              * `call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`: Invokes the function immediately, setting `this` to `thisArg` and passing arguments individually.
              * `apply(thisArg, [argsArray])`: Invokes the function immediately, setting `this` to `thisArg` and passing arguments as an array.
              * `bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)`: Returns a *new function* with `this` permanently bound to `thisArg` and optional preset arguments. It does *not* invoke the function immediately.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        const obj = { name: "Explicit Context" };
        function printName() {
          console.log(this.name);
        }
        printName.call(obj);   // "Explicit Context"
        printName.apply(obj);  // "Explicit Context"

        const boundPrintName = printName.bind(obj);
        boundPrintName();      // "Explicit Context"
        ```

      * **Arrow Functions (ES6+):**

          * Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this` binding. Instead, they lexically inherit `this` from their **parent (enclosing) scope** at the time they are defined. This makes them very useful for callbacks or when you want `this` to consistently refer to the `this` of the surrounding code.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        const user = {
          name: "Charlie",
          greetRegular: function() {
            setTimeout(function() {
              console.log(`Regular: ${this.name}`); // 'this' refers to window/global (unless bound)
            }, 100);
          },
          greetArrow: function() {
            setTimeout(() => {
              console.log(`Arrow: ${this.name}`); // 'this' refers to 'user' object (lexically inherited)
            }, 100);
          }
        };

        user.greetRegular(); // Regular: (empty or global object name)
        user.greetArrow();   // Arrow: Charlie
        ```

    Understanding these rules is key to debugging and writing correct JavaScript, especially when dealing with objects, callbacks, and asynchronous code.

7.  **What are "truthy" and "falsy" values in JavaScript? Give examples.**

    In JavaScript, every value has an inherent boolean quality, meaning it can be evaluated as either `true` or `false` in a boolean context (e.g., in `if` statements, logical operations like `&&` or `||`).

      * **Falsy Values:** These are values that coerce to `false` when evaluated in a boolean context. There are a fixed number of falsy values:

        1.  `false` (the boolean primitive `false`)
        2.  `0` (the number zero)
        3.  `""` (an empty string)
        4.  `null`
        5.  `undefined`
        6.  `NaN` (Not-a-Number)
        7.  `-0` (negative zero)
        8.  `0n` (BigInt zero, introduced in ES11)

        **Examples:**

        ```javascript
        if (false) { console.log("This will not run."); }
        if (0) { console.log("This will not run."); }
        if ("") { console.log("This will not run."); }
        if (null) { console.log("This will not run."); }
        if (undefined) { console.log("This will not run."); }
        if (NaN) { console.log("This will not run."); }

        let myVar = "";
        if (myVar) {
          // This block will NOT execute because "" is falsy
        }
        ```

      * **Truthy Values:** These are all values that are *not* falsy. When evaluated in a boolean context, they coerce to `true`. This includes virtually everything else.

        **Examples:**

        ```javascript
        if (true) { console.log("This will run."); }
        if (1) { console.log("This will run."); }       // Any non-zero number
        if (-5) { console.log("This will run."); }      // Negative numbers are truthy
        if ("hello") { console.log("This will run."); } // Any non-empty string
        if (" ") { console.log("This will run."); }     // String with only a space is truthy
        if ([]) { console.log("This will run."); }      // An empty array is truthy
        if ({}) { console.log("This will run."); }      // An empty object is truthy
        if (function() {}) { console.log("This will run."); } // Functions are truthy

        let data = "some data";
        if (data) {
          console.log("Data exists!"); // This will execute because "some data" is truthy
        }
        ```

    Understanding truthy and falsy values is essential for writing concise conditional logic in JavaScript.

8.  **Explain the concept of scope in JavaScript.**

    Scope in JavaScript defines the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some part of your code during runtime. It dictates where a particular variable or function can be used and where it cannot. JavaScript has different types of scope:

      * **Global Scope:**

          * Variables and functions declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.
          * They are accessible from anywhere in the entire program (script).
          * In a browser, global variables become properties of the `window` object. In Node.js, they are properties of the `global` object.
          * Overuse of global variables is generally discouraged as it can lead to name collisions and make code harder to maintain and debug.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        let globalVar = "I'm global!";

        function accessGlobal() {
          console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
        }
        accessGlobal();
        console.log(globalVar);   // Accessible
        ```

      * **Function Scope (or Local Scope):**

          * Variables declared with `var` inside a function are function-scoped. They are only accessible within that specific function and its nested functions.
          * They are not accessible from outside the function.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function outerFunction() {
          var functionVar = "I'm function-scoped!";
          console.log(functionVar); // Accessible inside outerFunction

          function innerFunction() {
            console.log(functionVar); // Accessible in innerFunction (due to lexical scoping)
          }
          innerFunction();
        }
        outerFunction();
        // console.log(functionVar); // ReferenceError: functionVar is not defined
        ```

      * **Block Scope (ES6+ with `let` and `const`):**

          * Introduced with ES6, `let` and `const` declarations are block-scoped.
          * A block is any code enclosed within curly braces `{}` (e.g., `if` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, standalone blocks).
          * Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block are only accessible within that block.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        if (true) {
          let blockLet = "I'm block-scoped with let!";
          const blockConst = "I'm block-scoped with const!";
          console.log(blockLet);   // Accessible
          console.log(blockConst); // Accessible
        }
        // console.log(blockLet);   // ReferenceError: blockLet is not defined
        // console.log(blockConst); // ReferenceError: blockConst is not defined

        for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          // i is only accessible within this loop block
          console.log(i);
        }
        // console.log(i); // ReferenceError: i is not defined
        ```

      * **Lexical Scope (or Static Scope):**

          * This is how nested functions resolve variables. A function's scope is determined by where it is *defined* (lexically) in the code, not where it is called.
          * Inner functions have access to variables declared in their outer (parent) scopes. This concept is fundamental to closures.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function outer() {
          let x = 10; // 'x' is in outer's scope

          function inner() {
            let y = 20; // 'y' is in inner's scope
            console.log(x + y); // 'inner' can access 'x' from 'outer'
          }
          inner();
          // console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined (y is inside inner's scope)
        }
        outer(); // Output: 30
        ```

    Understanding scope is critical for preventing variable name clashes, protecting data, and writing organized and predictable code.

9.  **What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)? Why is it used?**

    An IIFE (pronounced "iffy") stands for **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**. It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

    **Syntax:**

    ```javascript
    (function() {
      // Your code here
    })();
    ```

    Or with an arrow function:

    ```javascript
    (() => {
      // Your code here
    })();
    ```

    **Explanation of Syntax:**

    1.  `function() { ... }`: This defines a regular anonymous function expression.
    2.  `(function() { ... })`: Wrapping the function in parentheses makes it a function *expression* (rather than a function *declaration*), which allows it to be invoked immediately.
    3.  `(...)()`: The second pair of parentheses immediately invokes the function expression.

    **Why is it used?**

    The primary reasons for using IIFEs are:

      * **Creating a Private Scope (Data Encapsulation):** This is the most common and important use case. Before ES6 modules and `let`/`const` block-scoping became widely adopted, `var` variables were function-scoped. IIFEs provided a way to create a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting the global namespace. Any variables declared inside an IIFE (even with `var`) are confined to that IIFE's scope and cannot be accessed from outside. This helps avoid naming conflicts with other scripts or libraries.

        ```javascript
        // Without IIFE (global pollution)
        var counter = 0;
        function increment() {
          counter++;
        }
        // 'counter' and 'increment' are global

        // With IIFE (private scope)
        (function() {
          var privateCounter = 0; // 'privateCounter' is private to this IIFE
          function privateIncrement() {
            privateCounter++;
            console.log(privateCounter);
          }
          // We can't access privateCounter or privateIncrement directly from global scope
          // We can expose an interface if needed (see module pattern with IIFE)
        })();
        // console.log(privateCounter); // ReferenceError: privateCounter is not defined
        ```

      * **Module Pattern:** IIFEs are foundational to the JavaScript Module Pattern, where an IIFE returns an object containing public methods and properties, while keeping other variables and functions private within the IIFE's scope.

        ```javascript
        const myModule = (function() {
          let privateVar = "I am private";

          function privateMethod() {
            console.log(privateVar);
          }

          return {
            publicMethod: function() {
              console.log("I am public!");
              privateMethod(); // Can access privateMethod
            },
            publicProperty: "I am a public property"
          };
        })();

        myModule.publicMethod();      // "I am public!" followed by "I am private"
        console.log(myModule.publicProperty); // "I am a public property"
        // console.log(myModule.privateVar); // undefined
        ```

      * **Avoiding Variable Hoisting Issues (with `var`):** In pre-ES6 code, loops often had issues with `var` due to its function scope. IIFEs could be used inside loops to create a new scope for each iteration, capturing the correct value. (Though `let` largely solves this now).

    While `let` and `const` (for block-scoping) and ES6 Modules (for better module organization) have reduced the *necessity* of IIFEs in modern JavaScript, understanding them is crucial for reading older codebases and appreciating the language's evolution.

10. **How do you handle errors in JavaScript?**

    Error handling in JavaScript is primarily done using the `try...catch...finally` statement and by `throw`ing custom errors.

      * **`try...catch...finally` Statement:**

        This construct allows you to test a block of code for errors, handle them gracefully if they occur, and execute code regardless of whether an error occurred.

          * **`try` block:** Contains the code that you want to execute and monitor for potential errors.
          * **`catch` block:** If an error occurs within the `try` block, the execution immediately jumps to the `catch` block. It receives the error object as an argument, allowing you to inspect and respond to the error.
          * **`finally` block (Optional):** This block contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an error occurred in the `try` block or was caught by the `catch` block. It's often used for cleanup tasks (e.g., closing file streams, releasing resources).

        ```javascript
        function divide(a, b) {
          try {
            if (b === 0) {
              // Throwing a custom error
              throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero!");
            }
            const result = a / b;
            console.log("Division result:", result);
            return result;
          } catch (error) {
            // 'error' is the error object caught
            console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
            // You might log the error to a server, display a user-friendly message, etc.
            return null; // Or re-throw the error
          } finally {
            console.log("Division attempt finished.");
            // This code runs no matter what
          }
        }

        divide(10, 2);  // Output: Division result: 5, Division attempt finished.
        divide(10, 0);  // Output: An error occurred: Cannot divide by zero!, Division attempt finished.
        ```

      * **`throw` Statement:**

          * The `throw` statement allows you to create and throw a custom error (or any value) that can then be caught by a `catch` block.
          * You can `throw` built-in `Error` objects (like `Error`, `TypeError`, `RangeError`, `ReferenceError`, etc.) or custom error objects/messages.

        <!-- end list -->

        ```javascript
        function validateAge(age) {
          if (age < 0) {
            throw new RangeError("Age cannot be negative.");
          }
          if (typeof age !== 'number') {
            throw new TypeError("Age must be a number.");
          }
          console.log("Age is valid:", age);
        }

        try {
          validateAge(-5);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Validation Error:", error.name, error.message); // Output: Validation Error: RangeError Age cannot be negative.
        }

        try {
          validateAge("twenty");
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Validation Error:", error.name, error.message); // Output: Validation Error: TypeError Age must be a number.
        }

        try {
          validateAge(30);
        } catch (error) {
          // This catch block won't be hit
        }
        ```

      * **Asynchronous Error Handling:**

          * Errors in Promises are handled with `.catch()` or within `async/await` blocks using `try...catch`.
          * Uncaught errors in asynchronous operations (like `setTimeout` callbacks or network requests not wrapped in Promises) can sometimes be harder to track and might not be caught by a synchronous `try...catch`. Global error handlers (`window.onerror` in browsers, `process.on('uncaughtException')` in Node.js) can be used as a last resort for such cases.

    Effective error handling is crucial for creating robust and user-friendly applications by gracefully managing unexpected situations.
